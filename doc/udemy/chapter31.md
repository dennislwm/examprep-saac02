# Chapter 31. Security Standards

## Domain: Access control

The objective of this domain is to ensure that sufficient access management controls and formalized processes are in place so that the access to the organisation's assets and data by employees, contractors and third parties are only granted on the principle of least privilege, and managed in a controlled and consistent manner.

1. The organisation has implemented all the cybersecurity requirements to ensure that there are cybersecurity measures in place over who has access to the data and assets.

2. The organisation has established and implemented a privileged access solution that is appropriate and recognised in the industry to authenticate users and authorise access based on their roles to ensure that there is a more efficient and effective way of managing access.

### AWS IAM

* 1. You can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.

### AWS Identity Center

* 1. You can use multiple-account permissions to assign your workforce users access to AWS accounts. You can use application assignments to assign your users access to IAM Identity Center enabled applications, cloud applications, and customer SAML applications.

* 2. You can use IAM Identity Center for temporary elevated access management for both vendor-managed and supported solutions as well as self-managed and self-supported solutions.

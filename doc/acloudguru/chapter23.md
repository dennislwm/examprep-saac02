## Streaming Live Video in AWS Kinesis Video Streams

AWS Kinesis Video Streams is a way of **streaming media content from a large number of devices to AWS**, and then **running analytics, ML, playback and other processing**. Essentially, it elastically scales to millions of devices, and then stores, encrypts, and indexes video data in your streams, which you can then access through APIs.

### Use Cases

* Smart Home - think Amazon Ring, where you can stream video content from your Ring devices to Kinesis Video Streams and then run video recognition analysis on the data.

* Smart City - devices like CCTV cameras at traffic lights and junctions that can be monitored automatically.

* Industrial Automation - ingest time-encoded data, e.g. LIDAR, RADAR signals, and temperature sensors etc, and then provide industrial automation.
